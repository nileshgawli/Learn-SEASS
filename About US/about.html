        We connect people through knowledge. Whether you want to learn or to share what you know, youâ€™ve come to the
      right place. Education does not occur solely in the
      classroom, nor does it end with the completion of homework. We believe
      that education is a process that encourages children,self-learning
      coders,tech-geeks to think, experiment, analyse, question, and, most
      importantly, to believe. Seass , a online interactive learning platform
      rose from a desire to educate children. Our mission is to provide
      end-to-end online teaching and practicing platform for children and
      tech-geeks for improvement of their problem solving skills .
